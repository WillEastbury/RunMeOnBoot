# RunMeOnBoot
Three files to assist in resolving issues when a machine will boot up, but crashes on booting. 

One will remove a file via the \\machinename\C$ local admin share.
One will try the same over WinRM.
One will try and use the Windows Azure Guest Agent to launch the removal for all machines in a resource group.
